# vscode-sieve-formatter

Please note that this an incomplete formatter implementation - I just want trailing commas in lists [] and function args () removed to not go crazy while creating rules for Proton Mail! And was very suprised that no formatting extensions yet existed for Sieve.

When I next have time I will try to improve this and make any 2+ item list or function arguments appear on multiple lines, to play nicer with git.
